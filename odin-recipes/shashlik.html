    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>Beef Kebabs (or Shish kebabs) are a very important food and specialty of the Slavic people, but it’s not just limited to beef. Lamb, pork , chicken and even veggie kabobs are often on the menu!</p>
    <p><h2>Ingredients for Beef Kebabs</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs good quality beef (I used top sirloin), cut into 1 1/2″ pieces</li>
        <li>2 Bell peppers, any color, sliced into 1 1/2″ wide pieces</li>
        <li>1 large Purple Onion, sliced into 1 1/2″ wide pieces</li>
        <li>5 medium bamboo or wood skewers</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h2>Ingredients for Beef Kebabs Marinade</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup mild olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh lemon juice (from 2 medium lemons)</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt (we love fine sea salt)</li>
        <li>1 tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, pressed</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp fresh or frozen dill, chopped (or 1 Tbsp dry dill weed)</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine all of your marinade ingredients in a large glass or plastic bowl (do not use aluminum) and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Slice meat and transfer it into the marinade bowl, stirring well to coat. Marinate beef in the refrigerate4 to 6 hours, stirring a few times while marinating to make sure meat is evenly marinated. Note: Sometimes after long periods of refrigeration, the oil in the marinade can firm up a bit; it will liquify again if you let the marinated meat sit at room temp 30 minutes before skewering.</li>
        <li>Soak bamboo or wooden skewers at last 30 min. After the meat is done marinating, slice veggies and skewer them with meat onto Bamboo skewers. Brush/ pour remaining marinade over skewers.</li>

        <li>Grill over med/high heat for about 8-10 minutes or until you've reached the desired doneness, rotating every 2-3 minutes for even grilling. Remove kebobs from grill and let them rest at least 5 minutes before eating. If you cut into them right away, they will juice out and end up dry. Serve with your favorite steak sauce</li>
